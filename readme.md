# U.S. COVID Vaccination Map

#### Data as of 10/13/2021

---

This project aims to evaluate the geographic variation in the percent of people per county that are fully vaccinated. The data were taken from the [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh/data) website and displayed on the map using various JavaScript libraries like jQuery, Leaflet, and Chroma. Lower percentages of vaccination are displayed in warm colors (red and orange), while higher percentages of vaccination are shown in shades of blue.
